# About
Maker Goals Menubar was created to help you manage your goals on Product Hunt. It was built as part of the (Makers Festival - The 'API Edition')[https://www.producthunt.com/makers-festival/product-hunt-api-2-0] and became the winner of the Desktop Category.
This was my first Node, React, Electron application so I'm pretty sure there are a lot of things to improve. Feel free to contribute ðŸ˜Š
